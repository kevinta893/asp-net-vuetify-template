# asp-net-vuetify-template
A simple SPA template in ASP .Net Core configured for Vue+Vuetify. Demo has a simple button that keeps track of the number of pokes (button clicks) via an API.

# Development

1. Install all NPM dependancies using ```npm install```
2. Run the ```npm run watch``` command in the background so that updates are bundled to the page while the server is running (requires page refresh). See package.json for more commands. Recommended to use the Visual Studio Extension: [NPM Task Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.NPMTaskRunner) to manage NPM tasks in Visual Studio.
